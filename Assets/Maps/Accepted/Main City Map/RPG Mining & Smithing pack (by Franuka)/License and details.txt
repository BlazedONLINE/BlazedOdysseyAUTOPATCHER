Included are tilesets and spritesheets in three sizes: 100% (16x16px), 200% (32x32px) and 300% (48x48px), in .png format, transparent background. You should be able to recreate anything you see on the example images.

Characters' frame size is 48x48px (at 1x). I recommend playing the animations at 150ms/frame (6 or 7 FPS).

CHANGELOG
----------
v1.1: Added Cave entrances (2 versions), and a Pickaxe Signpost. Entrances can be used with my other tileset packs, as a way to enter the mines. Thanks S4P0 for the suggestion.

v1.2: Added signposts (signals), minecart stops, levers (3 states each) and animated Water tiles (9 tiles, 8 frames each).

v1.3: Extra smithy decoration (weapons, armour, tools, shields, racks, moulds, keys and shop counters to place stuff on)

v1.4: Added smithing animation for the miners, and mining animation for the smiths. Thanks Matthew for the request!
